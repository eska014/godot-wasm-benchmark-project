This is a simple 2D game for use with the Godot Engine WebAssembly benchmark at
https://github.com/eska014/godot/tree/wasm-benchmark

This is stripped directly from
https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/da4b221c63ba620b7a9e7c5eda40284122be8aab/2d/physics_platformer

Only change is the removal of sound and music. Audio is currently disabled in
Godot's HTML5 platform. Additionally, this saves on download size.
